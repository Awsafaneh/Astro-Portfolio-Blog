Not to long ago, I was scrolling video on youtube, finding something to watch as I was working on an android application, and then Youtube suggested this vide to me, *[Embrace GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI & ChatGPT as a developer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xu_QrZRYRw\&t=174s)* and I am a sucker, I watched the whole video and then it hit me a question should I use AI tools for making application, what are the side effects and how much should I use.

Like the questions to these answers, I have already disscused in my pervious blog post. *[My Love and Hate relationship with github- copiolet](https://www.rafay99.com/blog/mylovehaterelationshipwithcopilot)* and in that blog post, I conculded that there should be a limit on how much you use these tools.

But in the video, I only hera the plus points of using these tools, for example these can be help full to you for generating boiller code, if you rembr generating boilder code for flutter widget or an html page is a pain to create, and telling these tools to make me this widget with this title and meta data, they will do in a second.

This will make life easier, Like these task where pain for me, I just want to create some UI and Some logic so that my app can work. the other thing that was pointed out in the vide was the amount of refracing code, making some compoent into a seoerate compoent is good, make the code resulable and having the feature that cna be resulable make like easer to debug, add more features and much more.

These are solid points that are in the video but here is my hot take for the blog post.

## My Usage

I am going to be honest with you all ad a developer, I use these AI tools for learning news tech, Modifying the existing UI to make it much better, I am not a froent end developer and I might an idea what I need to build so I code it but I know it's not perfect so here is what I do,

I pass this prmote to the any AI tool, like chatGPT

> Consider your a designer and Developer with 5 years of experience, with this experience you are going to modify a UI. Here is the code. Now modify this UI and make it better.

With this Promote AI will fix most of the issue that I was happening in the UI and will make thing much better, but still not better, I still have to twak some of the things, for exmple, changing the fonts, icons or even the colors, not matching the whole style of the application.

## Hot take

Here is my hot take from all this video and my own thought, you should use these AI tools to learn, to refractor but don't use them to generate alot of code, becasue the code that AI will be generating won't be good and won't be hight qulaity plus not so much secure as well. Plus if you are a new dev and don't know anything then you are in trouble, because these AI will shorten your abibiluty to read docs and will make your debugging skills worst.
