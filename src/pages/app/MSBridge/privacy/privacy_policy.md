## Privacy Policy for MSBridge

**Effective Date: March 21, 2025**

Welcome to MS Bridge. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following information:

- **Personal Information:** When you register, we collect your email address and any other information you provide.
- **Notes and Tasks:** Your notes and tasks are stored locally on your device and synchronized with our servers.
- **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you use the app to improve our services.
- **Device Information:** We may collect device-specific information such as device model, operating system, and app version to ensure compatibility and enhance user experience.
- **Log Data:** When you use our app, our servers may automatically collect log data, including IP addresses, browser types, and timestamps.

## 2. Use of Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide and maintain our services.
- Authenticate your identity.
- Synchronize your notes and tasks across devices.
- Improve and personalize your experience.
- Communicate important updates, such as service changes or security notifications.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

We use Firebase services to store and manage your data. Firebase is a platform provided by Google that offers secure data storage solutions. For more information on Firebase's privacy practices, please visit their [Privacy and Security page](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption and access controls, to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Data Encryption

All authentication-related data is encrypted to ensure your privacy and security. This means that sensitive information is transformed into a secure format that cannot be read without proper authorization. Additionally, we use secure communication protocols (such as HTTPS) to protect data transmission.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. Third-party services we integrate with (e.g., Firebase) adhere to their own privacy policies, and we recommend reviewing them.

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Retention:** We retain your personal data as long as necessary to provide our services.
- **Deletion:** You may request to delete your account and associated data by contacting us. Once deleted, your data cannot be recovered.
- **Backup Policy:** We may maintain secure backups for a limited time to ensure service continuity and compliance with legal requirements.

## 7. User Rights

You have the right to:

- Access and update your personal information.
- Request deletion of your account and associated data.
- Withdraw consent for data processing (where applicable).
- Contact us regarding privacy concerns.

## 8. Children's Privacy

MS Bridge is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware of such data collection, we will take appropriate action to delete it.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page and, if required, through in-app notifications.
