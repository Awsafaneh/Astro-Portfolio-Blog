With the release of AI Chatbot that can generate code is pretty cool and with million of users all over the world is pretty good and it is amazing how the world is changing with this technology but it raise another question and is, Can AI write quality and secure code?

Writing code is one thing and writing code that is according to standards and is secure is another thing, having both thing in a code base can be though to achieve.

*Can AI really write better code then Humans, Moreover will it replace Software Engineers?*
