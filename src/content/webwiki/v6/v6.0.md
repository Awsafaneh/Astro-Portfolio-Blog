Get ready for a significant upgrade to my website! I'm thrilled to announce a major update (v6.0.0) to my personal Astro Portfolio Blog, focused on improving how you can find and interact with content here. This version represents a substantial leap forward, building upon the steady stream of enhancements I've been rolling out over the past few months (the v5.5.x series).

From better navigation to handy new features and extensive behind-the-scenes cleanup, this update is designed to make browsing the blog more intuitive and efficient for everyone.

## üöÄ What's New in Version 6.0.0?

This release brings several impactful changes:

### ‚ú® Feature: Introducing Subject-Based Note Browsing

One of the most significant additions is the ability to **organize and browse notes by subject**.

- **Dedicated Subject Pages:** We've introduced dynamically generated pages for each unique subject found in your notes. Now, visitors can easily navigate to a specific subject (e.g., "Research Methods," "Web Development") and see all related notes listed cleanly.
- **Improved Discoverability:** This makes finding relevant content much easier, especially as your collection of notes grows.
- **Focused Notes Listing:** The main notes index page now elegantly directs users to browse by subject, replacing the previous all-encompassing list for a more structured approach.

### ‚ú® Feature: Copy Code Buttons for Code Blocks

Working with code snippets just got much easier! We've integrated a **"Copy Code" button** directly into code blocks throughout the site.

- **One-Click Copy:** Users can now copy code examples with a single click, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** This small but mighty feature significantly improves usability for technical tutorials and documentation.
- **Clean UI Integration:** The button is styled to fit seamlessly with the existing design.

### üõ†Ô∏è Major Refactoring & UI Enhancements

Version 6.0.0 also includes significant under-the-hood improvements and visual refinements:

- **Simplified Layouts:** The layout for individual lecture notes has been streamlined, and the header structure improved for better readability and consistency.
- **Code Cleanup:** We've removed outdated configurations (like the old blog setup), unused properties (especially related to note tags which are now superseded by subjects), and unnecessary code, resulting in a leaner, more maintainable codebase.
- **Accessibility & Styling:** General styling and markup have been cleaned up across various components to improve layout, accessibility, and visual polish.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Reliability

- **Accurate Filtering:** Ensured that filtering logic consistently shows only published notes, preventing draft content from appearing unintentionally.

### üßπ Housekeeping & Documentation

- **Version Bump:** Officially updated the project version to **6.0.0**.
- **Structured Release Notes:** Added comprehensive release notes documentation for this version.
- **Removed Legacy Content:** Outdated legal/terms documentation for previous applications (like Simple Thread) has been removed to keep the project focused.
