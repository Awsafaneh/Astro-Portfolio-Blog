We’re excited to announce a new round of feature enhancements and UI improvements for the **Astro Portfolio Blog**. This latest update brings usability improvements, design refinements, and better maintainability to enhance the user and developer experience.

### **Key Changes in This Update**

#### **Project Section Conversion**

We’ve converted the **Project section into a content collection**, enabling streamlined management, improved scalability, and easier updates for future project entries. This change ensures that adding or editing projects is more efficient and intuitive.

#### **Detailed Project Notes**

To give users deeper insights into individual projects, we’ve added comprehensive notes to each project. This ensures that readers have all the context and information they need to explore your work.

#### **About Me Section: Tailwind CSS Conversion**

We’ve refactored the **About Me** section by converting all existing CSS into **Tailwind CSS**. This shift improves styling consistency, simplifies customization, and aligns the design system for easier updates.

#### **Tailwind CSS Configuration Update**

We’ve updated the **Tailwind CSS configuration file** with new custom colors, spacing, and font sizes. These updates support recent design changes and provide flexibility for future updates to the UI.

#### **Mobile View Bug Fixes for About Me**

We identified and resolved **mobile view issues** in the About Me section to ensure that it displays optimally on smaller devices, improving accessibility and user experience.

#### **Search UI Enhancements**

The **Search UI** has been fine-tuned to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Results are now displayed more clearly and efficiently to ensure users can find the content they need without hassle.

#### **Separation of Concerns for Maintainability**

We’ve refactored the codebase by separating the **UI from business logic**. This change improves maintainability, readability, and scalability of the project while ensuring future development is more modular.

#### **Contact Form Redesign**

The **contact form UI** has been revamped for better usability and visual appeal. It now offers a smoother user experience with updated design patterns and intuitive functionality.

#### **Data Organization Improvements**

We’ve consolidated configuration-related data by moving constants into `info.ts` under the **config folder**. This enhances data management and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

#### **Newsletter UI Enhancements**

We’ve improved the **Newsletter UI** by incorporating animations, refining its layout, and adding better support for comments and advertisements. This creates a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

#### **WhatsApp Integration for Easy Communication**

We’ve added a **WhatsApp social link**, allowing users to connect and communicate effortlessly.

#### **Comment Issue Fixes**

We resolved various issues affecting comments on both the Blog Post and Newsletter sections. These fixes ensure that user interactions with comments are seamless and functional.

#### **Social Share Button Refactor**

The **Social Share button** on Blog Posts has been split into two distinct parts: **Logic and UI**. This change improves maintainability and ensures that any changes to functionality or UI are handled independently.
