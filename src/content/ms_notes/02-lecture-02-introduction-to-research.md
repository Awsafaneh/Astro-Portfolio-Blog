Curiosity is something is is pretty common in every human begin, it will be present is some form, One human is curious about cars, new tech, knowledge anything in this word and this curiosity will lead to research about different thing,

There are some questions are we all ask when we do research, this process of finding some questions and answering these question will lead to the research.

## Meaning of Research:

In simple plain words, research is searching for facts or answers to the questions that you have designed, form or we ask our self. The main purpose is seeking solution to problems. it is a process of find out and organized inquiry.

We seek to find explanations to unexplained problem or phenomenon, to clarify the doubtful facts and to correct the misconceived facts.

## Background

But before we begin, what do I think of research, for me Research is pretty simple, Using the process to identify some problems and then finding the solutions to those problem, the solution can be related from another work or can be extension of another work. It all depends on the type of research you are doing.

*   Informal Definition:
    
    *   Research is defined as a careful consider of study regrading a particular concern or a problem using scientific method,
        
*   Organized, systematic, data based critical inquiry or investigation into a specific problem, undertaken with objective of finding answers or solution to it.
    

## What is Research?

To be honest, you know what is research, you do it every simple day, In the simplest word, Research is gathering the information you need to answer to a questions and thereby help you to solve a problem.

## Ways of Searching for Answers

There are multiple ways you can do search but in the lecture notes, I will be going through only two method.

1.  Arbitrary, crude or rudimentary methods.
    
    *   This process is very simple and this involves imagination, opinion and blind belief or impression. This method involves of gather any information from any means, it can be weak or from one person to another person as well.
        
    *   It's the rumour system, people talk and they talk all the gathered information lead to opinions and some kind of research method.
        
    *   You defined you own ways to do research
        
2.  Scientific, logical, systematic method.
    
    *   This process involves systematic rational approach to seeking facts. This method is purely based on the find facts and objective.
        
    *   Information gathered from facts, number and anything that lead to have some kind of evidence to back the facts that you are presenting.
        
    *   You follow a path that was provided with facts and evidence that proof your finding.
        

## What is research & what's isn't ?

My question is how can I objectively find what is research and what is not research.? that is something that I am curious about.

Research is not about gathering more information, it's not about transportation of facts from one location to another location. it's not about catchy words to get attention.

Research is based on the work of others - not a copy of their works, it can be replicated, it is generalizable to other settings, it's based on a theory some logical rationale and tied to theory. It generates new questions or is cyclical in nature. It is incremental the knowledge.

## Type of Research

There are mainly three types of research

1.  Non-Experimental
    
2.  Experimental
    
3.  Quasi Experimental
    

### Non-Experimental

In this type of experimental, we describe the characteristics of an existing done research, we expand the horizon of existing research and make sure to explain the research according to the author research paper, plus examine the relationship between variables are also explain, every single event that is described is carefully analyzed and then made sure that it explained.

### Experimental

In this type, we conduct some kind of actions, we theory the process and then action is performed on that theory this performance of action is know as experiment. We find the cause and effect and effects on relationships between different options

**For example:** Experiments are done in drug trial, psychology experiments and studies on new teaching methods.

### Quasi Experimental

In this type of experiment there is no full control over the test process, Test for casual relationship without full control is a type of nonrandomized study that often used when it's not feasible or ethical to conduct a randomized control trial.

Quasi-experimental research is a type of study that aims to evaluate causal relationships but lacks full randomization, making it distinct from true experimental designs. Here are some examples of quasi-experimental research:

**Example of Quasi Experimental**

**1\. Educational Policy Evaluation**

*   **Example**: A school district implements a new teaching method in one set of schools while others continue with the traditional approach. Researchers compare student performance before and after the implementation without random assignment.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: Schools are not randomly assigned to the new teaching method; selection may depend on administrative decisions.
    

**2\. Health Intervention Studies**

*   **Example**: A city introduces a smoking cessation program in certain neighborhoods but not others. Researchers measure changes in smoking rates before and after the program.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: Participants self-select or are selected based on location, rather than being randomly assigned.
    

**3\. Workplace Productivity Analysis**

*   **Example**: A company changes its work-from-home policy for some employees while others continue working on-site. Researchers analyze productivity differences.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: Employees are not randomly assigned to work-from-home or on-site conditions.
    

**4\. Public Policy Impact Assessment**

*   **Example**: A new minimum wage law is implemented in one state while a neighboring state maintains the old wage. Researchers compare employment trends over time.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: The law affects specific locations without random assignment.
    

**5\. Crime Reduction Strategies**

*   **Example**: A city installs more streetlights in high-crime areas but leaves others unchanged. Researchers assess crime rates before and after the intervention.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: Locations are chosen based on pre-existing crime rates rather than random selection.
    

**6\. Media Influence on Behavior**

*   **Example**: A region receives a public health campaign on television, while another does not. Researchers compare changes in public health behaviors.
    
*   **Why Quasi-Experimental?**: Exposure to the campaign is determined by regional broadcasting, not random assignment.
    

## Characteristic of Research

There are multiple steps involves in research and they are have few characteristic as well, which all of them are stated below:

1.  Research is Systematic:
    
    *   It's simple it start with a question and then you fond and tell the answer to solve a problem
        
2.  Research is Empirical:
    
    *   The finding you do must be based or some collected data with some evidence,
        
3.  Research is Logical:
    
    *   It's simple, In order to do a research, you need a plan and a specific procedure to follow.
        
4.  Research is Reproductive:
    
    *   In this main research problem is divided into smaller parts so that each sub-part is manageable.
        
5.  Research is Replicable:
    
    *   This is where reach of any author that has being published can be repeated with similar result.
        
6.  Research is Transmittable:
    
    *   This is the studies where finding ca be applied in new setting.
        

## The Scientific Method

This is a process that is defined as the processes of doing something task in a defined and proven way, For example in this method.

You can see in the above diagram there is a method of everything, from Asking questions to identifying stuff and then Hypothesize and then gathering data and then testing and Reconsider into a theory and from that more question are asked.

## Why to do Research?

The main purpose of the research is to identify the gaps and how they can help us to push and find new stuff, Reading, writing testing and driving more equation is push the knowledge to what can we do and what can we, to find the answers of the question we have driven before.

## How can you present your research paper?

Research paper is all up to your thinking process, how you see things and make sure that you are doing solid research, sometime your research is based on top of another people research.

## The main question is how can you do research ?

This is the research Process

1.  Select your topicc
    
2.  Refine your topic
    
3.  Identify Objectives
    
4.  Choose approach (Methodology)
    
5.  Explore your Topic (Gather Data)
    
6.  Perform Experiments
    
7.  Analyze the Data
    
8.  Write the paper/ repot
    

### Identification of Research Area

The topic for your research comes from gathering, Internet and much more. Some topic you like, Literature review, Brainstorming, Talking with friend and professional and much more way you can find a Topic for your research.

Communication is the key for everything, Connection and sharing is the best thing for knowledge and getting the idea that your like.

### What is Publication?

Research publication is a written document that presents the findings and results of a research study. Typically published in a scholarly journal or other recognized format, allowing the research community to access and evaluate the work done by researchers. A way to disseminate new knowledge generated through research to the wider academic field.

### Key Points for Publication:

When your are publishing your paper then there are some key points that you need to be in mind and here they are,

1.  Dissemination of Knowledge:
    
    *   The primary purpose of research publication is to share research finding with others in the field, enabling further discussion and development of knowledge.
        
2.  Peer review Process:
    
    *   When paper is submitted then publication will do peer review process, where other expert in their field will review your research, they will check everything from concept, to test to spelling check and grammar check and much more and when it is according to the quality then they will pass and publish the paper.
