Simon Peyton Jones, formerly of Microsoft, offered several recommendations for writing effective research papers.

**1\. Don't Wait: Write**

This principle suggests a streamlined process where you begin writing early in the research journey. Instead of the traditional approach:

\* Your Idea -> Do Research -> Write Paper

Peyton Jones advocates for:

\* Your Idea -> Write Paper -> Do Research

According to my lecture, the latter method is preferable. Writing early helps clarify and focus your ideas, crystallize your understanding, and identify gaps in your knowledge. This approach facilitates dialogue, enabling reality checks, critical feedback, and effective collaboration.

**2\. Identify Your Key Idea**

The aim is to convey a _useful and re-usable insight_ to the reader. Think of it as infecting their mind with your idea, like a virus. Remember, well-written papers are far more durable than programs! Great ideas are worthless if you keep them to yourself.

_Fallacy to Avoid:_ Thinking you need a fantastic, groundbreaking idea before you can write a paper.

Instead, write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how insignificant it may seem initially. _Do not be intimidated_. Writing the paper is how you develop the idea. It often turns out to be more interesting and challenging than you initially thought. Working in isolation can lead to stagnation, so sharing your ideas is crucial.

**The "Ping": One Clear, Sharp Idea**

Your paper should have just _one_ clear, sharp, reusable idea â€“ a "ping." You may not know exactly what the "ping" is when you start writing, but you _must_ know when you finish. If you have many ideas, write many papers.

Many papers contain good ideas but fail to distill what they are. Ensure the reader is in _no doubt_ about your core insight. Be 100% explicit:

\* "The main idea of this paper is..."

\* "In this section, we present the main contributions of the paper..."

Make sure your reader can "hear the 'ping!'" and clearly understand the reusable insight you are offering.
