While, while, what do we have here? There’s a new AI code editor in town called [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), brought to you by a company called Codeium. To be honest, I’ve been using Codeium AI as a VS Code extension, and with their stunning website, I was hopping off my chair and installed Windsurf the moment I learned about this new code editor on my machine.

But why do we need a new editor? Oh wait, it’s because Cursor already has 40,000 developers using their product, and that’s exactly why we need more competition, right?

So what are you waiting for? Go install it, and I’ll tell you everything about this editor. Because, for the sake of science and development, I’ve tried it, and I’m here to share everything with you all!

Before we dive deep into this new editor, let’s split this review into two parts:

1. The Good
2. The Bad

And believe me, the bad parts are way more fun, so let’s get started!

### The Good

Let’s kick things off with the good stuff and the features this AI code editor promises. According to the website, this editor aims to work alongside developers, creating a seamless flow between AI and human inputs. They call this collaboration *Flows*. I’m not making this up—that’s the wording straight from their site, which you can check out by [clicking here](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

They claim that the editor will index your codebase, and in the Composer, you simply enter the task. The AI then goes through the codebase and makes changes step by step. Pretty cool, right?

Another key feature is called *Cascade*. This one provides full context awareness, suggesting and running commands for developers. It also includes a "pick up where you left off" capability and handles multiple files seamlessly.

In other words, it’s like a smart text box that manages multiple files and performs operations across them. Sounds impressive!

### The Bad

Now, these features are cool and all, but here’s where things get a bit messy...

For this review, I cloned my Astro project from GitHub to see how it works in this new AI code editor. I opened the codebase in Windsurf and decided to test out the Cascade feature by asking it to guide me on how to run the project. You can check out the video below to see how it all played out:

<div
  style="
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 12px;

  "
>
  <iframe
    src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rbbPJnbbFpJBYjDTIDV1xxepDwLoCxpy/preview"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    style="
    max-width: 100%;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(31, 34, 40, 0.5);
    "
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

In the above video, you can see me prompting Cascade to tell me how to run the project. It started off by suggesting `npm`. Now here’s the thing: I use **nvm (Node Version Manager)** for my Node setup, which is a shell-based install, not a system-wide one. On the other hand, **Bun** is installed system-wide.

The AI first tried to use the system's Node.js, and unsurprisingly, it failed. There were a ton of warnings, and in the end, it just didn’t work. Next, it attempted to use Bun. It did work, but here’s the problem: it was **so slow**. It took more than 10 minutes to get this going.

And this is where I see a big issue. The AI can do some cool stuff, but it relies heavily on having the right environment set up on your system. Plus, the speed is a major letdown. Please, Codeium, I love your products—can you make it faster? Please!

Here is the fun part, When I run this Project using `bun run dev` then it did not work, so I have to reinstall all the dependiences using `bun install`. that is perfect.

### Final Thoughts

Look, I am trying very hard to make this product good but, I ma being honest here, the promosises are good but they are not cooked yet.

This is just the tip of the ice burge, I came across [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqbMXtxDZYc) Videos on the same tool and his experience was not good as well. He did even more testing then I did.

The workingflow is something about this AI I like it, the idea, It's good, the natural flow and making thing smooth and have single experience is a good idea but this need so much work.

So fo Me, I have installed this editior on my machine and I'll or might not use it depending upone the mood and nature.

Becase this took so long, I couldn't complete other test in time. Like add new features but check out [Theo's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqbMXtxDZYc) he has done alot more testing and give your a real experinece of this tool.

If it get better then I will write another blog Post and will make changes to this blog as well.

Untill then
