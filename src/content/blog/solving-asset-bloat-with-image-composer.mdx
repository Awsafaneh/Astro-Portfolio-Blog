As you may know, my blog has evolved significantly over time, transforming from a simple online journal to a comprehensive reflection of my personality and interests. This digital space has become a sanctuary where I can freely express my thoughts and feelings without reservation. However, building this online home, brick by brick, has not been without its challenges. When I was working on version 5 of my application, I encountered an unexpected and unprecedented problem - one that I never thought I'd face, but here we are.

## The Web Flow

Before I dive into the problem I'm facing, let me give you a quick rundown of how my website works. It's actually pretty simple. My site is built using Astro, React, Markdown, and Tailwind CSS. Each of these technologies plays a crucial role: Astro handles content rendering, React takes care of the UI, Tailwind CSS adds styles, and I write all my content in Markdown files.

I use a CMS to create content, which is then pushed to a GitHub repo called [Astro-Blog](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Astro-Portfolio-Blog). A GitHub action takes care of building and deploying the site to the internet. It's a simple, clean setup with no backend â€“ just code and a lot of Markdown files. Every time I add a new file or image to the repo, a new build is generated. This whole process is called Static Site Generation.

## The Problem

Now that you know how my site works, let's talk about the issue I'm facing. It's a pretty straightforward problem, but it's been causing me some headaches. I'm talking about asset management. I add images to my blog posts, and there are a lot of them. Depending on the project, the number of images can vary. The problem is that these images are hosted in the \_public folder, which needs to be small and fast. As I add more elements to the images, their size increases, causing performance issues.

You might be thinking, "Why are you adding so many large images to the public folder? You shouldn't be doing that!" And you're right; I shouldn't be. But here's the thing: my blog thumbnails have changed, and I need to move forward, not backward. I don't have a choice in the matter.

According to the [Astro Docs on Images](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/), if I'm using the Astro Image component, I should put images in the src folder. However, if I'm using the img tag in HTML, the images need to be in the public folder. The problem is that I'm using React for every single page, and all the UI is built with React, Tailwind, and designed with... well, you get the idea. I can't use the \<Image> component in my React code without causing errors throughout the codebase.

So, there you have it. Large assets are now a big problem for me because performance and load times are suffering.

## The Solution

While the solution is very simple, use image compressor but here is the thing, Image compressor sucks, like there are a dozen of image copressor out there but they have alot of problems right of the box. Sometimes they are too slow to load, some times, they are
