Alright, let's hear it. We've all been there—you have an idea for an app that could help you out, and you realize it could help others as well. But you don’t know how to create a good application, or moreover, you have no idea how to build one.

Now, you go on YouTube and start searching, and the number of videos is overwhelming. You watch one, then two, but when it comes down to actually starting from nothing, things start to get a little rough.

You don’t know the app flow, how users will interact with it, or even what features you need. And that’s perfectly normal. As a beginner trying to build an app, you don’t yet understand how things should flow.

The purpose of this blog post is to show you all how to build an app from scratch. I’ll go through everything—from the idea to development, all the bugs I encountered, how to solve them, and how AI can be helpful.

# The Idea?

For this app, I was writing my notes on a website and could access them via the web. But what about mobile? It was really inconvenient to open a browser, enter a URL, and then visit my notes. And sometimes, the internet isn’t reliable. So, now what?

The solution for me was simple—I needed an app where I could read all my lecture notes with offline access.

With that in mind, I started writing down what I needed. The core idea was that I should be able to read my notes without an internet connection. My website already has API access, so I could call that API and render the content in the app, right?

It’s simple and can be done.

# The Features

Once the core idea was set, it was time to think about what features would support it and ensure the app wasn’t misused. So, I added these features:

1. Offline & Online Access
2. Auth System
3. Color Choices
4. Note-Taking

These features would make note reading much smoother and more convenient.

# Tech Stack

Once you have all the features listed and know what you want, the next step is choosing a good tech stack. People say it doesn’t matter what tech stack you choose, but let me tell you—when it comes to apps, you generally have four options for the frontend:

1. Flutter
2. React Native
3. Java (Android)
4. Swift (iOS)

And for the backend, there are several good options:

1. Firebase
2. Supabase
3. Appwrite
4. PocketBase

All of these options have their own pros and cons. If you’d like to see a core difference between Firebase and Supabase, check out my previous [blog post](https://www.rafay99.com/blog/firebase-vs-supperbase/).

I haven’t used PocketBase or Appwrite yet, but I’ve heard they are good options.

## My Choice

For me, I’ll be using Flutter for the UI and Appwrite for the backend. The backend will handle user sync, note-taking, user authentication, and the auth gate—nothing more than that. The UI will be coded using Flutter because I use Flutter for everything, and I love its flexibility.

## Your Choice

Don’t choose blindly—do your research and pick what makes you comfortable and what you feel confident coding in. If I weren’t used to Flutter, I would have gone with React Native, since I know how React works but have no experience with React Native. So, choose what works best for you.

# Layout

with all these, each fucntion will have their own screen and user can acess the notes as well. To make a offline section of app rember you need to make the data need to avaible in the local database.
