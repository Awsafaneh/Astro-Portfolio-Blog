## Project Categorization & Documentation Updates

We’re thrilled to introduce a new set of updates that focus on better organization, enhanced documentation, and improved development workflows. This pull request brings new features, critical bug fixes, and documentation improvements that aim to streamline usability and clarity.

## New Features

We’ve added a new _Project Categorization_ feature. This allows users to sort and view projects based on categories using the newly introduced **Project Category** field. Additionally, the project description for _"Immune Defenders"_ has been expanded to include gameplay insights and detailed installation instructions.

## Bug Fixes

We identified and resolved an issue with image paths across various project documentation. These corrections ensure all images now load correctly and maintain proper visibility for better user experience.

## Documentation Improvements

Enhanced clarity and consistency have been added to the project descriptions, along with better formatting. These adjustments make documentation easier to read and more user-friendly.

## Development Workflow Improvements

The package versions have been updated, and the development script has been modified to simplify environment setup. This streamlines the development process and ensures faster onboarding for future contributors.
