We all know I develop Android and iOS applications using Flutter — and I’m pretty good at it. Building an application is just one part of the game. The real challenge often lies in the second part: **deploying** those applications to the respective app stores.

Now, here's the truth:\
I mainly develop Android applications because I **don’t own an Apple device**, which means I can’t test or deploy apps to the Apple Store. That’s a story for another day.

But today, we’re going to talk about something closer to home — the **harsh reality of deploying Android applications on the Google Play Console in 2025**.

> Buckle up, because it’s going to be a hell of a ride.

This blog post is my personal journey of deploying an Android app after a long time. Things have changed, and if you’re getting back into it after a while, you might want to read this all the way through.

## A Little Context

In one of my previous blog posts, I shared the journey of building a new Android app called **[MS Bridge](https://ms-bridge-app.vercel.app/)**. It’s a simple note-reading and note-taking application — something I built because I was never really a fan of Google Keep. I wanted to create a tool that met **my own workflow** and personal needs.

And guess what?\
I actually use this app **every day**.

If you’re curious about the build process or want to see how I made it using Flutter, check out the full write-up [here](https://www.rafay99.com/blog/idea_to_app/). In that blog post, I dive into the architecture and the thought process behind the app.

## TL;DR

A while back, deploying apps on Google Play Console used to be **simple**:

* You paid a one-time $25 fee.
* Filled out your developer profile.
* Generated and uploaded a signed AAB file.
* Completed a few forms and privacy declarations.
* Shared demo credentials (if applicable).
* And then, waited 2–3 business days for a manual review.

If all was well, your app would go live and be available to users around the world. **Easy, right?**

Well, that was then.

## The Past: How It Used to Be

Back in the day, Google had **the most lenient rules** for deploying apps. Whether those rules were too relaxed is up for debate, but for indie developers like myself, it was manageable.

The flow was straightforward:

* Buy access to the Play Console for $25 (one-time payment).
* Verify your identity with a valid ID.
* Build and sign your APK or AAB file.
* Create a new release and fill out the required forms.
* Upload your AAB, and submit it for review.

If everything was filled out correctly, your app would get approved — no fuss, no confusion.

It was a **solo dev's dream**.

## The Present: A Reality Check

I won’t lie — I haven’t deployed Android apps myself in a long time. Nowadays, I usually just **build and test** the apps, while someone else on the team handles deployment.

But recently, a client came to me with a request that required me to **handle everything** — including the deployment.

That’s when I realized just how much things have changed.

Google has **restructured** the deployment process significantly. New identity verification steps, stricter policies, longer wait times, and even more granular forms to fill out.

I’ll walk you through that updated process — what changed, what’s still the same, and what to watch out for — in the next section of this blog.

In late 2022, Google annocuceted new google play console, and for developer and companies, both need to have at least 12 testing requiremnts and this was the killing pain for me, As a solo dev, where I do everything, from building to testing and to deploying the application, this 12 tester approved tester requiremnts you can read the requirments on [google play blog](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/15899442)

Now according to this policy and change as soon as an application is sent under review you have to alot of testing meaning, 12 tester will test the application for at least 4  mins stright from 12 different deveices with different 12 google accounts, this is absolutly non sences, as a solos dev and with small devices, I can afford 12 device, espcially, in my region, android devices are expensives,

I can see the upflow to this, why google have done this,
