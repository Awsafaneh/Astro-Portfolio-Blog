We’re bringing you another round of improvements, feature additions, and cleanups to make your experience better, faster, and more intuitive. This latest release introduces new configurations, collections, improved error handling, and a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

### New Features

We’ve introduced a few exciting features into **TinaCMS** for better content management:

- A **new "newsletter" collection**, allowing seamless newsletter content management directly within TinaCMS.
- A **"projects" collection** to simplify project management and organization.
- A **"siteConfig" collection**, allowing centralized management of site-wide configurations like author details and social links.

Additionally, we’ve updated the application version to **5.0.0**, marking a significant step forward with this release.

### Bug Fixes

Error handling has been enhanced across various components to ensure improved user experience and prevent unexpected crashes.

### Documentation Improvements

We’ve updated and clarified import paths across the application for better maintainability and streamlined logic. Additionally, read time calculation logic has been cleaned up with improved comments for better understanding and clarity.

### Code Clean-up

To streamline the codebase, obsolete files and configurations have been removed. This includes TypeScript files with legacy or unnecessary information such as `info`, `traffic.ts`, and the `author.ts` file. This cleanup ensures a leaner, more efficient project moving forward.

### Accessibility & Style Updates

We’ve prioritized improved accessibility by adding descriptive titles to SVG components. This change ensures all users can interact with the content in a more intuitive way.

### Chores & Technical Changes

We’ve switched configuration files from JavaScript modules to JSON, streamlining data management and ensuring better performance.
