We’re excited to share the latest updates that bring enhanced features, improved performance, and better organization to your experience. This release introduces trending blog posts, improved error handling, and better rendering logic for an overall smoother and more intuitive user experience.

## What’s New

We’ve introduced a new **`readTime` property** for blog posts, helping users gauge how long it will take to read any given article. Additionally, we’ve added functionality to fetch and display trending posts from an external API, enhancing engagement with popular content.

## Improvements

Our error handling mechanisms have been updated across multiple components, especially for feature flags, ensuring fewer interruptions and better reliability. Alongside this, blog rendering now includes estimated reading time, offering users better insights into content consumption.

## Dependency Updates

The package version has been bumped to **4.9.0**, and new dependencies like **Axios** and **dotenv** have been added. These additions optimize external API requests and environment variable management.

## Refactor

We’ve also improved code maintainability by restructuring the import paths for configuration and utility modules. This change ensures a more organized and streamlined development experience for long-term scalability.
