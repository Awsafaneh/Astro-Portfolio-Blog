While, while, what do we have here? There’s a new AI code editor in town called [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), brought to you by a company called Codeium. To be honest, I’ve been using Codeium AI as a VS Code extension, and with their stunning website, I was hopping off my chair and installed Windsurf the moment I learned about this new code editor on my machine.

But why do we need a new editor? Oh wait, it’s because Cursor already has 40,000 developers using their product, and that’s exactly why we need more competition, right?

So what are you waiting for? Go install it, and I’ll tell you everything about this editor. Because, for the sake of science and development, I’ve tried it, and I’m here to share everything with you all!

d=before we break down everything from this new editor, let's break this into two parts.

1. The goods.
2. The Bads

And believe me the bad are much fun, so let's begin.
