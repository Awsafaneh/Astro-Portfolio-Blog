Alright let's hear it, we all being there we have an idea about an app that can help me out and you see it can help other peoples as well, but you don't know how to create a good applications, or mover over you don't have any idea how to build an app.

Now you go on YouTube and you start searching, anf the amount of video are too much, you watch one and then two when you come down to starting building an app from nothing, it's started to get little rough.

You don't know how to app flow, how users will use the app or you don't know what features you are looking and this perfectly normal. As a begineer who want to build app you don't know how things can actually flow.

The purpose of this blog post is two show you all how to build an app from nothing. I will be going through everything, from idea to an app to all the bugs that I have encountered, how to solve them and How AI can be helpful

# The idea?

For this app, I was writing my notes on website and I can acess them via web but what about mobile, its really rough for me to open the browser, enter a URL and then visit the notes and sometime, internet is not good so, Now what? the Solution for me I need a app where I can read all my lecture notes, and I need to have a offline acess as well.

With that in mind, I started Writing down what I am looking for, The core Idea is that I need to read without internet. and my website have API Acess so I can call that api and then render the content into the app right?

It's simple and can be done.

# The Features

Once the core idea was set now, it's time to think about the overall what features need to be there to supprt this core ideas and make issue that you app is not being miss used and for that I added these features
