I just got my first Job in year 2022 after my bachalor's degree, and I started my carrer as a Machine Learning Engineer and then the First AI boom hit, Chat gpt was realeased and chage the course of the history so much that I couldn't imangine, it was so grounding chnaging that I could not believe, Like I known AI was but the the entire AI changed and with soem time the era, *"The Era of AI"* was born.

With time different tools for differnt AI was born from coding to writing blogs to SEO and even for managing task as well. people where adding open AI APIs into their application and add warpper around them, like this is cool but one time that I want to talk about Code Review.

## Old Method

let's go back in time and let's talks about how code review was done. it was simple, You code something make a pull request and then submit the pull requestion any code reviwer will review your code and tell you to make changes into the code base and then you make the change into the code base then request nad then if every thing is alright then your code is merged into the main code base and that was it, this process was simple but yet skill full, Senior and Junior Devs both have to watch out what would cause the issue and the code quality looks good.

## Ai Written Code

AI has changed everything and now everyone was writing code using AI this was new and known as *"Vibe Code"* if you want to knwo what is vibe coding then checkout my pervious [blog Post](/blog/rise-of-vibe-coding/).

With Vibe Coding in place, everyone was writing code using AI their will be cases where AI writing code will have some downside for example, NO code optimzation, bugs and some time casuing alot of issue in the code base and even some time break the whole application as well. Not too long ago I can across a video on YouTube of Theo talks about a Twitter Post about where AI generate code Cause a company like *10 Thousand US Dollars* like this is crazy and Theo rais some solid points if you like to watch the vide then free will to check it out. It's Amazing YouTube Viddeo

## Code Rabbit

Let's be honest, everyone is using AI to do some basic style, write boller code heck even I use AI to do repeated task, plus I use AI to do some designing on MY project, I suck at design and color pallet so I use AI for these things

and with all these AI Generated code you need to review the code and that's where [Code Rabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) was born, the main thing is that code rabiit will review all your pull request and will suggest changes based on the code base as well. it totally free for all public repo and for this blog post I enabled code rabbit on all my projects.

And Holly Molly, it's good, I used it and I can not believe it acctually works like 90 pecent of the times, suggesting improvement my hell written code base.
