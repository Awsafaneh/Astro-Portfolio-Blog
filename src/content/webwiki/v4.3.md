We’re excited to share powerful upgrades to the **Astro Portfolio Blog** with improved search features and tag support! This latest enhancement introduces a new, intuitive user interface and allows better content organization, making it easier for readers to discover blog posts and newsletters that interest them.

### **What's New?**

#### **Tags Support for Blogs**

We’ve added robust **tags support** directly integrated with Tina CMS. Now, authors can effortlessly add, manage, and update tags for each blog post. Tags make content categorization simpler and help readers find topics that align with their interests.

#### **Improved Search UI & Logic**

We’ve revamped the search functionality with a sleek new dropdown menu in the search bar. Users can now filter search results by categories such as **Blogs** and **Newsletters**, or by tags. This makes navigating content faster and more intuitive.

Additionally, we’ve introduced enhanced filtering logic to exclude draft blog posts from search results. This ensures that only published and relevant content is shown, offering readers a cleaner and more accurate search experience.

#### **Tag-Based Search**

The new **tag-based search** feature empowers users to quickly locate blog posts related to specific themes or topics. Whether you’re interested in a specific subject or just browsing, this functionality provides an effortless way to discover relevant content.

#### **Code Cleanup for Better Performance**

To keep the application lean and efficient, we’ve removed outdated and unused code. This cleanup has streamlined the codebase, boosting performance and maintainability for future development efforts.

### **Tina CMS Enhancements**

We’ve also updated **Tina CMS** to seamlessly support tag management. These changes make it easier for content managers to organize, maintain, and categorize blog content without added complexity.

With these enhancements, managing blog posts and newsletters has never been simpler or more efficient.

### **Why These Changes Matter**

These improvements directly benefit both the users and the content managers behind the scenes. Readers can now enjoy a faster and more intuitive way to search for and explore blog content, while authors and administrators can better categorize and manage content using tags.

The improvements make navigation smoother, searches faster, and content discovery more engaging, all while enhancing performance and maintainability.
