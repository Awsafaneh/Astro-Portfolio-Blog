In today's world, privacy feels like a joke. No matter how hard you try, if you're tech-savvy but don’t fully understand what you’re doing, you’re pretty much doomed. Companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others are constantly building profiles on your data to serve you ads. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With this sheer amount of data, they can manipulate your mood, your personality, and even your decisions.

That’s terrifying, isn’t it? Someone out there, tweaking how you think and feel? That’s not okay. So, where do we even begin to fight back? For me, it starts with search. I’ve always dreamed of building my own search engine. As a software engineer who loves tinkering with tech and software, it doesn’t feel like an impossible task. I mean, how hard could it really be, right?

But, hold on. I’ve never actually done this before. Building your own search engine sounds cool, but it has to be practical too. I don’t want to dive into a project that just eats up my time and energy without any real payoff. So, before I jump in, here are some burning questions I need to answer:

* What’s the cost of running a search engine? I’m not exactly rolling in cash, so even a few extra dollars can feel like a burden.
* Is it really private, or is that just a scam?
* How easy is it to set up and maintain? Could anyone do this on their own machine, or is it a tech nightmare?
* Can it stay up-to-date automatically? Or will I need to manually update it with the latest web pages and news (because, let’s be honest, that sounds exhausting)?

These are the questions that need answering before I start. If you’re curious too, stick around—we’re going to figure this out together.

How are we going to deploy this Private Search Engine, There is a an open source Project called [SearXNG ](https://github.com/searxng/searxng). Even I did not know about this Project upon some Searching on YouTube, Reddit and Google I came across this Project and everyone is say it's pretty good, even there is a video of [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifT6npY39Dw) . Great Video and I loved what he has done in that vide, You have to check it out. 

Here is the main kicker for this Project, You need to have Linux or Mac. Most Search engine work on Linux and there is no around it, You can use WSL for Windows and Docker as well and that is what I'll be doing on my system, I am too lazy to boot into Linux and start my whole work flow so, I will be using docker and WSL 2, Wish me good luck. 

If any case you have not installed docker or WSL on your machine then check these official guides from Docker and Microsoft. 

1. [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
2.  [WSL Installation ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

I have used this guide to install WSL and Docker on my system, read them carefully and both these thing will be on your system.
