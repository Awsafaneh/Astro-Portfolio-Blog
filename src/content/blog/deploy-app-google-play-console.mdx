We all know I develop Android and iOS applications using Flutter — and I’m quite good at it. Building an application is one part of the game, but the second part is deploying Android and iOS applications.

Here’s the truth: I develop Android applications because I don’t have an Apple device to test or deploy my apps to the Apple Store. But today, we’re going to talk about the hard reality of deploying Android applications on the Google Play Console.

Buckle your belt, because it’s going to be a hell of a ride.
 This is my journey of deploying an Android application after a long time.

### TL;DR

A long time ago, you paid for access to the Google Play Console. Once you were in, you added your email, name, and then created a release for your application.

After that, you'd create a signed AAB file for your Android app, fill out some forms, provide a few details, and share a demo username and password. Once everything was set up, your application would go through a review process that usually took two to three business days. If everything was good, your app would be deployed to millions of users around the world.

That was the process for quite a while.
 But then Google changed the policy — and the whole structure.

I don’t know what the new structure is exactly. I don’t deploy Android applications anymore. I just build and test them — the deployment is now handled by other team members.

But recently, a client came up, and I had to deploy the application myself.
 So now, we’re going to explore the new process of deploying an Android application.
