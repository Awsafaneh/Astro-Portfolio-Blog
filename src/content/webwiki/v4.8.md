We’ve made a series of updates to enhance TinaCMS support, improve blog asset management, and clean up sensitive API keys from the codebase. This update ensures better organization, improved metadata, and documentation clarity while addressing key usability improvements for a smoother user experience.

## Changes

We’ve taken critical steps to make **TinaCMS** integration more efficient by removing sensitive API keys entirely from the codebase. Additionally, blog post image assets have been redirected to a new folder to ensure TinaCMS can easily access and manage these images.

## New Features

The **version number has been updated to 4.8.0** to reflect these changes, and we’ve improved the organization of blog image assets. Hero images for multiple blog posts are now neatly grouped under new paths for improved access and compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

We’ve resolved inconsistencies in metadata labels like _"Thumbnail Image"_ and _"Project Description"_. These fixes ensure metadata remains accurate and uniform, improving both the development experience and the end-user interface.

## Documentation Updates

We’ve also added more clarity to the blog post _"Web Assembly in Flutter"_. This now provides greater insight into how WASM integrates with Flutter, improving understanding for readers.

## Style Improvements

Improved grammar and readability have been applied across several blog posts to create a more professional and engaging reading experience.
