Curiosity is something is is pretty common in every human begin, it will be present is some form, One human is curious about cars, new tech, knowledge anything in this word and this curiosity will lead to research about different thing,

There are some questions are we all ask when we do research, this process of finding some questions and answering these question will lead to the research.

## Meaning of Research:

In simple plain words, research is searching for facts or answers to the questions that you have designed, form or we ask our self. The main purpose is seeking solution to problems. it is a process of find out and organized inquiry.

We seek to find explanations to unexplained problem or phenomenon, to clarify the doubtful facts and to correct the misconceived facts.

## Background

But before we begin, what do I think of research, for me Research is pretty simple, Using the process to identify some problems and then finding the solutions to those problem, the solution can be related from another work or can be extension of another work. It all depends on the type of research you are doing.

*   Informal Definition:
    
    *   Research is defined as a careful consider of study regrading a particular concern or a problem using scientific method,
        
*   Organized, systematic, data based critical inquiry or investigation into a specific problem, undertaken with objective of finding answers or solution to it.
    

## What is Research?

To be honest, you know what is research, you do it every simple day, In the simplest word, Research is gathering the information you need to answer to a questions and thereby help you to solve a problem.

## Ways of Searching for Answers

There are multiple ways you can do search but in the lecture notes, I will be going through only two method.

1.  Arbitrary, crude or rudimentary methods.
    
    *   This process is very simple and this involves imagination, opinion and blind belief or impression. This method involves of gather any information from any means, it can be weak or from one person to another person as well.
        
    *   It's the rumour system, people talk and they talk all the gathered information lead to opinions and some kind of research method.
        
    *   You defined you own ways to do research
        
2.  Scientific, logical, systematic method.
    
    *   This process involves systematic rational approach to seeking facts. This method is purely based on the find facts and objective.
        
    *   Information gathered from facts, number and anything that lead to have some kind of evidence to back the facts that you are presenting.
        
    *   You follow a path that was provided with facts and evidence that proof your finding.
        

## What is research & what's isn't ?

My question is how can I objectively find what is research and what is not research.? that is something that I am curious about.

Research is not about gathering more information, it's not about transportation of facts from one location to another location. it's not about catchy words to get attention.

Research is based on the work of others - not a copy of their works, it can be replicated, it is generalizable to other settings, it's based on a theory some logical rationale and tied to theory. It generates new questions or is cyclical in nature. It is incremental.
