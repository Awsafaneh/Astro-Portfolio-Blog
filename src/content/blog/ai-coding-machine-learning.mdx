I am develoepr and with all this AI talk, I started to wonder something and that was Can AI write better code then a human experience Programmer, with the sales terms and bench marks it s sure that AI can solve exiting problem but can AI really predict some real life questions.

With the release of AI Chatbot that can generate code is pretty cool and with million of users all over the world is pretty good and it is amazing how the world is changing with this technology but it raise another question and is, Can AI write quality and secure code?

Writing code is one thing and writing code that is according to standards and is secure is another thing, having both thing in a code base can be though to achieve.

*Can AI really write better code then Humans, Moreover will it replace Software Engineers?*

# The Answer

The short answer how is reading this blog the answer is *NO*, AI will not write clean and secure code. If you stay let's breakdown why AI is not writing good and clean code.

## Struggles of AI

Ai Struggles to write clean amd secure code due to multiple reasons and factors, The complexity of writing cleaning code.

### Contextual Understanding:

The reaality of AI is that AI does not have deep Understanding of contenctual insight that human have, which means they may miss the nuances needed for higt quality, clean and secure code.

### Code Quality & Standaerds

Clean code involves readability, simplicity, and modularity, all of which are influenced by coding practices, style guides, and conventions specific to different languages or projects.
While AI can mimic style patterns seen in its training data, it lacks the ability to consistently apply these standards creatively or adaptively, especially in complex, real-world applications.

### Security Challenges:

Writing secure code requires awareness of potential vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.) and implementing secure design patterns.
AI can learn some secure coding practices from its training data, but it may overlook less common vulnerabilities or fail to adapt to new security threats without retraining.
