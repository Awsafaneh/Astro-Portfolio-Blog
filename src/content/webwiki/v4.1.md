We are excited to announce **Version 4.1** for the **Astro Portfolio Blog**. This latest update introduces a small yet impactful change to improve content flexibility by transitioning from traditional Markdown to **MDX**. This change opens up new possibilities for dynamic and interactive content across the platform.

## **Whatâ€™s New in Version 4.1?**

### **Content Type Change to MDX**

With this update, we've transitioned the content type from `md` (Markdown) to `mdx` (MDX). This change allows the integration of dynamic components and interactive features directly within markdown files. The move to MDX enhances the flexibility of content creation, enabling richer experiences for both content creators and readers.

MDX allows authors to seamlessly embed React components, interactive widgets, and other dynamic elements, making the blog content more engaging and versatile.

## **Why MDX?**

The shift to **MDX** isnâ€™t just a technical change; itâ€™s a step towards a more interactive and feature-rich content platform. By supporting MDX, weâ€™re enabling dynamic user experiences and giving content creators the ability to extend static markdown with React-powered interactivity.
