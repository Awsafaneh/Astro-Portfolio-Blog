While, while, what do we have here? There’s a new AI code editor in town called [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), brought to you by a company called Codeium. To be honest, I’ve been using Codeium AI as a VS Code extension, and with their stunning website, I was hopping off my chair and installed Windsurf the moment I learned about this new code editor on my machine.

But why do we need a new editor? Oh wait, it’s because Cursor already has 40,000 developers using their product, and that’s exactly why we need more competition, right?

So what are you waiting for? Go install it, and I’ll tell you everything about this editor. Because, for the sake of science and development, I’ve tried it, and I’m here to share everything with you all!

Before we dive deep into this new editor, let’s split this review into two parts:

1. The Good
2. The Bad

And believe me, the bad parts are way more fun, so let’s get started!

### The Good

Let’s kick things off with the good stuff and the features this AI code editor promises. According to the website, this editor aims to work alongside developers, creating a seamless flow between AI and human inputs. They call this collaboration *Flows*. I’m not making this up—that’s the wording straight from their site, which you can check out by [clicking here](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

They claim that the editor will index your codebase, and in the Composer, you simply enter the task. The AI then goes through the codebase and makes changes step by step. Pretty cool, right?

Another key feature is called *Cascade*. This one provides full context awareness, suggesting and running commands for developers. It also includes a "pick up where you left off" capability and handles multiple files seamlessly.

In other words, it’s like a smart text box that manages multiple files and performs operations across them. Sounds impressive!

### The Bad

Now, these features are cool and all, but here’s where things get a bit messy...
