### **What is Plagiarism?**

Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s words, ideas, images, sounds, or creative work without proper acknowledgment, presenting them as your own.

* * *

### **Why is Plagiarism a Serious Issue?**

A major study by Donald L. McCabe (Rutgers University) involving nearly 4,500 students across 25 schools revealed:

*   **74%** admitted to **serious cheating on tests**
    
*   **72%** admitted to **serious cheating on written assignments**
    
*   **Over 50%** admitted to **plagiarizing content from the Internet**

### **How to Know if You’re Plagiarizing**

Ask yourself:

*   Have I used someone else's ideas or words without citing them?
    
*   Did I receive unauthorized help on this assignment?
    

If yes, you may have committed plagiarism—intentionally or not.

* * *

### **Types of Plagiarism**

#### **Intentional Plagiarism**

*   Copying another student’s work
    
*   Buying or borrowing papers
    
*   Copying and pasting from online sources without citation
    
*   Using media without permission or credit
    
*   Republishing content online without rights
    

#### **Unintentional Plagiarism**

*   Poor paraphrasing
    
*   Inadequate or missing citations
    
*   Over-reliance on quotations
    
*   Failing to express ideas in your own voice
    

* * *

### **Common Excuses for Plagiarism**

*   "It’s okay if I don’t get caught!"
    
*   "I had no time—too much homework!"
    
*   "My teachers assign too much!"
    
*   "I need straight A's to get into college!"
    
*   "Everyone else does it!"
    
*   "This assignment was boring!"
    

These justifications do not lessen the consequences or ethical implications.

* * *

### **Why Academic Integrity Matters**

*   **Learning**: Cheating undermines your own education.
    
*   **Respect**: Crediting sources is a matter of fairness.
    
*   **Credibility**: Citing adds authority and trust to your work.
    
*   **Reputation**: Academic dishonesty damages personal and institutional trust.
    
*   **Ethics**: Integrity is essential in both academic and professional life.
    

* * *

### **Real-World Examples of Plagiarism Consequences**

*   **Stephen Ambrose & Doris Kearns Goodwin**: Reputational damage and job resignations.
    
*   **Senator Joe Biden**: Withdrew from the 1987 presidential race due to plagiarism allegations.
    
*   **Mike Barnicle (Boston Globe)**: Resigned over plagiarized columns.
    
*   **Jayson Blair (New York Times)**: Resigned after multiple articles were found to be plagiarized or fabricated.
    
*   **NJ Valedictorian**: Lost a seat at Harvard for plagiarizing a published article.
    
*   **University of Virginia Case**: 45 students expelled, 3 graduate degrees revoked.
    

* * *

### **Possible Academic Consequences**

*   A zero grade on the assignment
    
*   Notification of parents/guardians
    
*   Referral to administration
    
*   Suspension from sports or extracurriculars
    
*   Academic record marks
    
*   Damaged standing in the school community
    

* * *

### **Plagiarism in the Professional World**

Would you trust a:

*   **Lawyer** who cheated on the bar exam?
    
*   **Architect** who plagiarized their coursework?
    
*   **Accountant** who had others do their work?
    

Professional integrity is built on academic honesty.

* * *

### **When is Citation Required?**

You **must cite** when:

*   Using direct quotes
    
*   Paraphrasing or summarizing others' ideas
    
*   Referring to data or facts not considered common knowledge
    

#### **What is Common Knowledge?**

Facts widely known or easily verified (e.g., "Water freezes at 0°C") do **not** require citation.

> **Tip**: If a fact appears in three or more credible sources and is generally known, it’s likely common knowledge.

* * *

### **How to Use Sources Responsibly**

#### **1\. Quoting**

Use exact words from a source. Best used for powerful statements or precise definitions. Must be cited.

#### **2\. Paraphrasing**

Rewriting ideas in your own words and sentence structure. Still requires citation.

#### **3\. Summarizing**

Condensing the main ideas of a larger text in your own words. Also must be cited.

* * *

### **Smart Note-Taking Tips**

*   Use quotation marks or a **"Q"** for direct quotes
    
*   Mark paraphrased ideas with a **"P"**
    
*   Always include source details and page numbers
    

* * *

### **In-Text and MLA Documentation**

*   Use **MLA style** for citing sources:
    
    *   (Author Last Name Page Number) — e.g., (Smith 203)
        
    *   If no author: use a shortened title — e.g., (“Plagiarism and the Web”)
        
*   In-text citations must correspond with full entries in your **Works Cited** list
    

#### **Example**:

> “Slightly more than 73% of Happy High School students reported plagiarizing papers” (Smith 203).

* * *

### **Key Takeaways**

*   Plagiarism is a serious ethical and academic offense
    
*   Proper citation respects the original creator and supports your credibility
    
*   Always blend quotes, paraphrases, and summaries thoughtfully
    
*   When in doubt—**Cite!**
