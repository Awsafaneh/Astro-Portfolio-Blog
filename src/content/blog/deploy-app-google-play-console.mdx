We all know I develop Android and iOS applications using Flutter — and I’m pretty good at it. Building an application is just one part of the game. The real challenge often lies in the second part: **deploying** those applications to the respective app stores.

Now, here's the truth:\
I mainly develop Android applications because I **don’t own an Apple device**, which means I can’t test or deploy apps to the Apple Store. That’s a story for another day.

But today, we’re going to talk about something closer to home — the **harsh reality of deploying Android applications on the Google Play Console in 2025**.

> Buckle up, because it’s going to be a hell of a ride.

This blog post is my personal journey of deploying an Android app after a long time. Things have changed, and if you’re getting back into it after a while, you might want to read this all the way through.

## A Little Context

In one of my previous blog posts, I shared the journey of building a new Android app called **[MS Bridge](https://ms-bridge-app.vercel.app/)**. It’s a simple note-reading and note-taking application — something I built because I was never really a fan of Google Keep. I wanted to create a tool that met **my own workflow** and personal needs.

And guess what?\
I actually use this app **every day**.

If you’re curious about the build process or want to see how I made it using Flutter, check out the full write-up [here](https://www.rafay99.com/blog/idea_to_app/). In that blog post, I dive into the architecture and the thought process behind the app.

## TL;DR

A while back, deploying apps on Google Play Console used to be **simple**:

* You paid a one-time $25 fee.
* Filled out your developer profile.
* Generated and uploaded a signed AAB file.
* Completed a few forms and privacy declarations.
* Shared demo credentials (if applicable).
* And then, waited 2–3 business days for a manual review.

If all was well, your app would go live and be available to users around the world. **Easy, right?**

Well, that was then.

## The Past: How It Used to Be

Back in the day, Google had **the most lenient rules** for deploying apps. Whether those rules were too relaxed is up for debate, but for indie developers like myself, it was manageable.

The flow was straightforward:

* Buy access to the Play Console for $25 (one-time payment).
* Verify your identity with a valid ID.
* Build and sign your APK or AAB file.
* Create a new release and fill out the required forms.
* Upload your AAB, and submit it for review.

If everything was filled out correctly, your app would get approved — no fuss, no confusion.

It was a **solo dev's dream**.

Absolutely, here's a refined and polished version of your paragraph with proper grammar, improved flow, and a tone that still sounds like *you*. I’ve also made it blog-ready and added it as a continuation of the previous section.

## The Present: A Reality Check (continued)

In late 2022, Google announced a major update to the Google Play Console — and with it came a new policy that hit indie developers the hardest.

Both **individual developers** and **companies** are now required to meet at least **12 testing requirements** before submitting an app for review. You can read the full breakdown of the policy [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/15899442).

And let me tell you — this was a **huge pain point** for me.

As a solo developer, I handle everything myself: designing, building, testing, and deploying the app. But now, before even submitting the app for review, I need **12 testers**, each with a **different Google account**, using **12 different physical devices**, who must test the app for **at least 4 minutes straight**.

Seriously?\
This feels absurd.

I don’t have access to 12 Android devices. Devices are **expensive**, especially in my region. And coordinating 12 unique testers with valid Google accounts just to meet a requirement? That’s a lot of overhead for someone working alone.

To be fair, I understand where Google is coming from. They want to **prevent low-quality or crash-prone apps** from reaching production. In the past, many developers pushed broken apps to production without proper testing, which damaged user experience and hurt the reputation of the Play Store.

So yes, the **intent** behind this policy makes sense — but the **execution**? Not so much.

For solo devs and small teams, this is a major hurdle. And it’s one more reason why deploying Android applications is no longer the simple process it used to be.
