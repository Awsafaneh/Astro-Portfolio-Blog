Alright, let's hear it. We've all been there—you have an idea for an app that could help you out, and you realize it could help others as well. But you don’t know how to create a good application, or moreover, you have no idea how to build one.

Now, you go on YouTube and start searching, and the number of videos is overwhelming. You watch one, then two, but when it comes down to actually starting from nothing, things start to get a little rough.

You don’t know the app flow, how users will interact with it, or even what features you need. And that’s perfectly normal. As a beginner trying to build an app, you don’t yet understand how things should flow.

The purpose of this blog post is to show you all how to build an app from scratch. I’ll go through everything—from the idea to development, all the bugs I encountered, how to solve them, and how AI can be helpful.

# The Idea?

For this app, I was writing my notes on a website and could access them via the web. But what about mobile? It was really inconvenient to open a browser, enter a URL, and then visit my notes. And sometimes, the internet isn’t reliable. So, now what?

The solution for me was simple—I needed an app where I could read all my lecture notes with offline access.

With that in mind, I started writing down what I needed. The core idea was that I should be able to read my notes without an internet connection. My website already has API access, so I could call that API and render the content in the app, right?

It’s simple and can be done.

# The Features

Once the core idea was set, it was time to think about what features would support it and ensure the app wasn’t misused. So, I added these features:

1. Offline & Online Access
2. Auth System
3. Color Choices
4. Note-Taking

These features would make note reading much smoother and more convenient.

# Tech Stack

Once you have all the features listed and know what you want, the next step is choosing a good tech stack. People say it doesn’t matter what tech stack you choose, but let me tell you—when it comes to apps, you generally have four options for the frontend:

1. Flutter
2. React Native
3. Java (Android)
4. Swift (iOS)

And for the backend, there are several good options:

1. Firebase
2. Supabase
3. Appwrite
4. PocketBase

All of these options have their own pros and cons. If you’d like to see a core difference between Firebase and Supabase, check out my previous [blog post](https://www.rafay99.com/blog/firebase-vs-supperbase/).

I haven’t used PocketBase or Appwrite yet, but I’ve heard they are good options.

## My Choice

For me, I’ll be using Flutter for the UI and Appwrite for the backend. The backend will handle user sync, note-taking, user authentication, and the auth gate—nothing more than that. The UI will be coded using Flutter because I use Flutter for everything, and I love its flexibility.

## Your Choice

Don’t choose blindly—do your research and pick what makes you comfortable and what you feel confident coding in. If I weren’t used to Flutter, I would have gone with React Native, since I know how React works but have no experience with React Native. So, choose what works best for you.

# The Flow

You know the features, You know, how to choose a teach stack, now it's time to define a the flow, meaning that how user will nivgiate from one page to another, and this very simple, when user install your applicatin what the user will see first, it could be a Login Screen, Introduction Screen, Splash Screen, anything, according to your through and your application. for me thse where the flow that I created for My application.

## The Auth Flow

The auth flow will show how the authentication is done on an application

### Login

Installed -> Introduction Screen -> Login -> Sucess -> Home Screen
Installed -> Introduction Screen -> Login -> Failed -> Error Message

### Register

Installed -> Introduction Screen -> Register -> User created -> Login -> Sucess -> Home Screen
Installed -> Introduction Screen -> Register -> User NOT created -> Error Message

### Auth Gate

User Logged -> Home Screen
User Note Logged In -> Login Screen

## Note Fetching Feature

This is the flow of the app, how app is working under the hood.

### Getting Notes Via API

App Opened -> Internet Connection -> Call API(Get Data) -> Store in Local Database -> Show User
App Opened -> NO Internet Connection -> Siwtch to offline Mode

### Taking Notes

Open App -> Switch to Note taking UI -> Create Note -> write some content -> Saved content

## Flow Thoughts

So on you can see how the flow the app is working,
this is just the beginning, as you have more features the more flow you need, it's better to have one Structure and start coding and thne as you go you will see how the flow will be set.
I can only tell these flow, becuase I have done it,I have created the app and I came across all the Flow how the app should go from one UI to another UI.

# Coding

Okay, you have thing, Now what ? it's one question that everyone don't know, how can I code the app, You have design, you have the flow of the app and most important the app idea and Tech stack selected.

While short answer is just google and use AI. as your begining, google alot of stuff, don't just ask AI you will forget but use google, using google and stack overflow, you will remember how to resolve error.
And start coding, if you new then read docs of the language, watch some videos to get things started.

# My App Issue

This was not all sun shine and rainbows, there where few issues and they took some time to resolve, Normally, I want to take a week to make this app and by mine time, and github it did took a week to build the app.

So when I started the app, I created the UI and setup the backend which was Appwrite, wverything was perfectly fine untill appwrite won't add user to my database, I was getting alot of issue and then I decidded to switch from app write to Firebase and My UI was seperated from the backend, all I need to chnage the backend and nothing need to be changed in the frontend of the application.

Make your both end seperated and connect them via a repo file, where all the data will meet and all the logic can perform.

So Now okay, I get the firebase setup, fixed the authm register user and evereything was working great, Now it's time to setup the API for getting the notes from my website.

I used https package from pub.dev and it was great, it was getting the data into the api but the body or the main notes where not getting through, this was an issue, so I set up local database called hive and it's preety good, as local database, it's pretty good, not easy tos etup but very nice, Once the model for Hive was set and few command later, everything from the api was being placed into the local database expect the body, so I decidded to switch the local database  and turn out it was an api call issue.

After hours of dev work, I fixed and the data was comming plus beeing saved into the hive database.
Now, it's time for the UI, we
