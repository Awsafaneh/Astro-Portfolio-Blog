If you know me, you already know I love writing blog posts like a story — taking you on a little journey while telling you what's happening. Today is no different.

Last night, while I was writing a blog post, a thought popped into my mind. I had set the blog post’s publish date sometime in the future. But I knew myself well — when that day came, I would definitely forget to **enable** that blog post manually.

And guess what? After a few months, that blog post would still be stuck there — unpublished — because I forgot to change `draft: true` to `draft: false`.\
That pissed me off so much. Like seriously — what the hell? I wrote the blog, finished it, set the publish date, but it would still sit there hidden just because I wanted to space out my posts instead of dumping them all at once.

The blog was **done**. It was **built** with the site files. It was just sitting there, needing to be enabled.\
Sounds simple to fix, right?\
Well... not so much.

Like every other software engineer when they're stuck, I went to Google and searched:\
`auto schedule a post in astro`

I came across a few blog posts that were close to what I was looking for — and honestly, they were **so well written** that I highly recommend you read them:

1. [jonathanyeong.com - Blog Post 01](https://jonathanyeong.com/writing/changelog-scheduling-posts-with-astrojs/)
2. [destiner.io - Blog Post 02](https://destiner.io/blog/post/draft-publications-and-post-scheduling-in-astro/)

Both blog posts made some solid points, and I genuinely enjoyed reading them.\
But... they didn’t exactly solve the problem **I** was facing.

So, like any desperate developer, I asked AI for suggestions.\
Spoiler alert: the AI suggestions were a complete **miss** for brainstorming.\
Sometimes AI can help. Sometimes it just makes you want to close your laptop and go outside.\
But before I explain how I *actually* solved the problem, you first need to understand **why** this problem exists.

## The Problem with Static Sites

Astro is a **static site generator**.\
Everything for my site is built ahead of time and hosted on GitHub — **there’s no backend**.

(If you’re interested, I explained my entire website setup in this [blog post](/blog/solving-asset-bloat-with-image-composer/), but here’s the TL;DR:\
Everything is static. Every change requires a **full rebuild** of the site.)

Because of this, any functionality that needs **dynamic behavior** (like auto-scheduling posts) **can’t just magically happen** at runtime.\
There’s no server to "wake up" on a certain day and publish the post.\
The site is already frozen in time until the next rebuild.

So what’s the solution?
