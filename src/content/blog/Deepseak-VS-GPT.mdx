While...While what do we have today an new AI model that is going wild on the interent and it's called Deepseak. The new thinking AI Model that will take our Jobs, Just Kidding, But the future is here these new thinking model are really fasinated and the abilityto think on tyour own is awesome.

But we are here to see which one is better, by now we have seen all the benchmarks and they lead to that deepseak(R1) model is better then ChatGPT(O1) model. but how much can how this improvement can help us the developer, plus how can we make money, becasu that is what captlastist do. but that's the topic for anyother day, let's talk about AI.

If you have not seen the benchmarks there ther image is down there have a look.

okay, with that so which one is better for common use for developing. So for this, I have designed 4 tasks. ans each task have two section, One dection is realted to coding nad second is realted to Problem solving.
and here are the Tasks.

#### **Section 1: Code Innovation & Uniqueness**

✅ **Task 1:**\
Write a function that sorts a list of numbers **without using built-in sorting functions**. Try to implement a novel approach, avoiding classic sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Bubble Sort.
✅ **Task 2:**\
Create a function that generates random yet **aesthetically pleasing ASCII art** based on a given keyword (e.g., "mountain," "wave," or "tree"). The output should have a pattern rather than random characters.

#### **Section 2: Problem-Solving with Constraints**

✅ **Task 3:**\
Design an algorithm to find the **shortest path in a maze**. The maze is represented by a 2D array, where `0` represents an open path and `1` represents a wall.

* The AI must provide a **unique approach** rather than simply implementing BFS or Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

✅ **Task 4:**\
Write a function that generates **efficiently compressible JSON** while maintaining readability. The AI should consider:

* Reducing redundant keys
* Using data structures that aid compression
* Preserving human readability

## Base Rules

Before we begin, I am using the free version of both companies, Open AI free acess and Deepseak Free acess, no paid acess.
