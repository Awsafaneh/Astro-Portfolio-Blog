We’re thrilled to announce a new round of updates introducing security enhancements, UI improvements, and backend support to streamline your experience. This update focuses on strengthening security with hCaptcha integration, improved contact form functionalities, tag feature enhancements, and better overall system performance.

### **Key Highlights of This Update**

#### **hCaptcha Integration for Security**

We’ve added **hCaptcha verification** to the contact form to protect against spam submissions and automated bot activity. This key is securely stored in the `.env` file, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

#### **Contact Form Hook & Home Page Enhancements**

The contact form has been upgraded to improve data validation and server-side handling. Furthermore, the home page now integrates this new contact form setup, providing a smooth experience from submission to response.

#### **Notion Integration for Better Data Management**

Backend support has been improved by adding **Notion API integration via WebForm**. With this, all submitted contact data can now be sent directly to the `Rafay99.contact` page in Notion. This feature is toggleable via a dedicated control system, allowing you to enable or disable this integration without requiring code changes. Additionally, all Notion-related API configurations have been moved to a clean, dedicated location to ensure better organization and ease of access.

#### **Tag Feature UI Enhancements**

The tag handling system has received significant upgrades:

- Resolved a bug causing disabled tags to display incorrectly.
- Improved the **Tag Section UI**, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Added **pagination support in the tag view**, making it easier to browse through large sets of tagged pages.

#### **Code Cleanup & Bug Fixes for Better Performance**

We’ve cleaned up unnecessary code and optimized the **Newsletter and ShareButton Schemes** for improved performance. This also includes fixes to the connect button and resolving blockers impacting user functionality. Additionally, the version has been updated for tracking purposes.

### **Why These Changes Matter**

This update introduces several benefits:

1. **Enhanced Security**: The addition of hCaptcha ensures that user data remains safe and protected.
2. **Streamlined Contact Data Integration**: Through Notion’s API, all user submissions are now efficiently stored and accessible.
3. **Improved User Experience**: With better tag navigation, UI updates, and fixes, users can explore content more seamlessly.
4. **Flexible Configuration**: The toggle-based Notion integration allows adjustments without diving into code changes.
5. **Codebase Optimization**: The clean-up ensures better maintainability, scalability, and faster performance.

### **Testing and Verification**

We recommend testing the following:

1. Ensure that the **contact form submission** with hCaptcha security checks works flawlessly.
2. Verify **Notion integration** by testing both active and disabled states to ensure proper data submission functionality.
3. Confirm that the **tag UI updates**, including pagination and bug fixes, display correctly and enhance user navigation.
